# ImageCaptioning
Image captioning task by model of LSTM/Attention mechanism/Transformer - PyTorch

This task is mainly focuses on the performance of models of LSTM/LSTM+Attention/Transformer on different datasets, which are Flickr30K, 102 Category Flower Dataset and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. The encoder applied here is a pretrained ResNet50. 

From the results, the frame work of encoder-decoder can efficiently extract the image features and generate a reasonable discription.
